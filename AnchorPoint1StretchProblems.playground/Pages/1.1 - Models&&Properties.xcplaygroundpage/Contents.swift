 ### Open a new Swift playground. Create a Person class with three properties:
 
 * name property whose type is String.
 * favoriteColor property whose type is an optional String.
 * favoriteMovie property whose type is an optional String.

 ### Create Memberwise Initalizer:
 * Create a custom initializer where you set the name.
 
 ### Call it:
 * Then, outside of the Person class, create an instance of Person and initialize it with your name. Set either the favoriteColor OR favoriteMovie property.
 
 ### Print:
 * Next, print out a description of the person's favorite things, being sure to properly handle the optionals beforehand.
 * Also print out the optional property you didn't set and observe the result.

 Create a function that will print out a description of a person's favorite things, or say that the person doesn't like anything. This function should work properly whether or not the optional properties were set. Example printouts below
 ### Examples:
1. "John's favorite color is blue."
2. "John's favorite movie is Star Wars."
3. "John's favorite color is blue and his favorite movie is Star Wars."
